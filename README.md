# Pulse-AI

Pulse-AI is an AI-powered assistant application built using **Spring Boot**, **Gemini API**, and a **React frontend**. The system enables continuous, context-aware verbal conversations between users and the AI agent. The application also supports personality customization, allowing developers to easily configure the AI’s response style and behavior through system prompts.
